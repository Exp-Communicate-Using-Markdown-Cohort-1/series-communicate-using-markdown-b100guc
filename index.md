### Blockchain Ledger

The blockchain ledger is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant manner. It is a key component of blockchain technology, which is a decentralized and distributed technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as various other applications.

Here are some key features and concepts related to the blockchain ledger:

##### Decentralization:
Unlike traditional centralized ledgers maintained...

##### Transparency:
The blockchain ledger is typically public, allowing anyone...

##### Immutability:
Once a block of transactions is added to the blockchain, it is extremely...

##### Consensus Mechanisms:
 In order to add new transactions to the ledger, nodes on the network...

##### Smart Contracts:
In addition to recording simple transactions, blockchain ledgers can also...

##### Cryptocurrencies:
Many blockchains, especially the first and most well-known one, Bitcoin, use...

### Here's a simple example of how you might implement SHA-256 hashing in Python.

```
import hashlib

def sha256_hash(data):
    # Create a new SHA-256 hash object
    sha256 = hashlib.sha256()

    # Update the hash object with the bytes-like object (data)
    sha256.update(data)

    # Get the hexadecimal representation of the hash
    hashed_data = sha256.hexdigest()

    return hashed_data

# Example usage
data_to_hash = b"Hello, World!"  # Note: Bytes-like object
hashed_result = sha256_hash(data_to_hash)

print(f"Original Data: {data_to_hash.decode('utf-8')}")
print(f"SHA-256 Hash: {hashed_result}")

```
